# youtube-vid-summarizer
A lightweight script that uses AI to summarize the latest youtube video from a creator of your choice

# How to Use:
1. enter your anthropic and openAI API keys into the fields below (inside the quotes following api_key)
2. enter the name of the channel containing the video you wish to summarize
3. run the script! The video summary will be printed out to the console.

## Note:
This script works better with longer videos. more video time = more data to interpret = better summary!
