# youtube-vid-summarizer
A lightweight script that uses AI to summarize the latest youtube video from a creator of your choice

# How to Use:
1. Enter your anthropic and openAI API keys into the client objects (inside the quotes following api_key)
2. Enter the name of the channel containing the video you wish to summarize
3. Run the script! The video summary will be printed out to the console

## Note:
The app works better with longer videos. more video time = more data to interpret = better summary!

## Future Plans:

I intend to turn this into a web app with an interactable GUI and AI voice narration
